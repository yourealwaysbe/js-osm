JS-OSM
======

Experiments with rendering OSM data in browser on an HTML5 canvas.


Usage
=====

Direct your browser to index.html.  Download some OSM PBF files (possibly from
[here](http://download.geofabrik.de/) and load them with the button on the top.


Notes
=====

PBF parsing is courtesy of [osm-read](https://github.com/marook/osm-read).
Large PBF files will choke at the moment.
